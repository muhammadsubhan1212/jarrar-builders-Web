# Images Directory

## Required Image

Please add a Dubai skyline image file named `dubai-skyline.jpg` to this directory.

The image should be:
- High resolution (recommended: 1920x1080 or larger)
- Aerial view of Dubai showing the skyline
- Preferably showing Burj Al Arab or other iconic Dubai landmarks
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP

The image will be used as the background for the hero section.

## Alternative

If you don't have the image yet, you can:
1. Use a placeholder service temporarily
2. Update the CSS in `src/components/Hero/Hero.css` to use a different image path
3. Or use a gradient/color background until the image is ready
